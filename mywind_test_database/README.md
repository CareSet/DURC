Test database

This is a hacked  fork of https://github.com/dalers/mywind
Which is itself an example of the Microsoft Northwind database

It is modified specifically as a test platform for https://github.com/CareSet/DURC

Which means that it splits the original databases into multiple database, in order to intentionally add complexity to 
the DURC compiler. It also enforces the DURC naming convention.
